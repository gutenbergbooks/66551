Night
</h4>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">ho</span> hath not sung to thee, Night? So silent; so deep. But this night
thou hast given thyself to me. Thy black wings brush silently against my
soul.
</p>

<p>
Thou hast come to me, for I feel thee resting like a soft sorrow on my
heart.
</p>

<p>
Thou who art alive with the shadowed wounds of ages hast heard me
crying out to embrace thee, my soul beseeching thee to fold me against thy
black bosom. And in answer thou hast let the mysticism of thy wonder-gloom
sink into me until my soul hath opened to receive its kiss.
</p>

<p>
Tonight no one but I shall sing to thee. For thou art my mistress.
Thy blackness and mine have wedded. And now thy dark kiss stingeth like
a pain in me.
</p>

<p>
Into thy long arms I give myself. Night, Night, thou art so filled with
longing. I hear the soft lament of thy deep heart murmuring to me.
</p>

<p>
Thy dim fingers trail across my face in a blind caress.
</p>

<p>
I feel thy yielding body that is spirit more than my spirit behind the
somber veils thou wearest. I possess thee and our sorrows swell into an
ecstacy.
</p>

<p>
Night, thou art the beautiful shadow thrown upon the earth by my
sorrow.
</p>

<p>
I have carried thee a buried miracle in my soul of souls until this hour—when
thou hast taken wings and flown out of me to confront me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-2" class="pagenum" title="2"></a>
Night, my Night, let me enter now into thy darkness until all life beats
in vain outside the obscurity of my soul. I would vanish from myself.
</p>

<p>
Night, my somber mistress, upon thy face my tears shine as stars and
make thee more beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Night, thou art infinity revealed. I will stir thy ancient fires on thy
cold lips until thou willst thunder to me with thy hidden voices out of thy
vast silence.
</p>

<p>
Night, I open my heart to hear but I hear only my heart crying out.
Speak.
</p>

<p>
Beautiful one, I sing to thee for bringing me the madness of silence.
I sing to thee, for thou art mine; for thou art fierce and pregnant with still
wounds.

<p>
Night. Behold! I know thee. I have seen the black flames of thy
spirit that burn in the depths of thee. I have heard the murmuring music
of thy tears.
</p>

<p>
Thou art glorious. Come. Come, thou and I shall make of our sorrow
rejoicing. Come, place thy long, cool fingers in mine and lead me beyond.
</p>

<p>
Night! Night! Thy face is paling. Thou art stricken. Thou art
treading silently away without me.
</p>

<p>
Night—thou hast taken from me the pain of thy kisses. There hath
come into thy deep eyes a weariness. Thou art dying. Thou art dying
from my arms. The red glow of death burneth in thy face and is transforming
thee.
</p>

<p>
Night, where shall I find thee again? Where shall I seek thee?
</p>

<p>
The dreadful day that is thy white shadow hath come. And a part
of me hath died.

Sleep Song

<p class="noindent">
I lay in a field of black flowers, and there were purple veins and green
that floated like thin worms about me.
</p>

<p>
There were soft thick shapes swaying liquidly, moving unseen, and I
lay under them gripped by soft thick mists.
</p>

<p>
Deep under them I lay hidden and they pulled me deeper into the field
rolling softly around me.
</p>

<p>
A sorrow that had pursued me in my soul left me as I vanished, left
me and floated above the flowers.
</p>

<p>
And I saw a white face drifting away like a pale bubble over the top
of my black garden.
</p>

<p>
A white face like a dim sorrow, like a mute pain, drifting far away;
the white face of a dead love searching in vain for me, in vain.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-3" class="pagenum" title="3"></a>
The day was a white monster, naked and bellowing; grinning after
me with its buildings that were jagged rows of dirty teeth. There was no
place to hide from my sorrow.
</p>

<p>
It lay in the sky that winked at me like a vast and blue and relentless
eye. And it lay in the sun that burned like a golden grotesque. It lay in
every laugh and in every beauty and in every little bird that lost itself over
the water.
</p>

<p>
I felt the black flowers grow blacker and higher and I moved deeper
into the blackness.
</p>

<p>
And then a sorrow that had pursued me in my soul left me as I
vanished.
</p>

<p>
It floated away over the tops of the black flowers and I saw her white
face moving from me like a pale bubble.
</p>

<p>
I saw the white face of a dead love moving beyond the soft shapes that
swayed unseen; drifting away like a mute pain and searching in vain for
me, in vain.
</p>

<p>
I ran, but there was no place to run; for the monster day ran after,
glaring like a white torment, shouting and scampering after, and there was
no place to hide.
</p>

<p>
Now the day was a white grave opened to me. Now it was a wide
wave breaking over me.
</p>

<p>
And now it was a great bird, white-breasted and grey-pinioned, flying
after me and after, bearing my sorrow in its blue beak; racing after me
until its heart burst in the west and it sank, bleeding gorgeously across
the sky.
</p>

<p>
And still I ran; but now the night came, running after, and there was
no place to hide from my sorrow.
</p>

<p>
I fled in the streets before the darkness. But the stars found me and
the trees loomed after me and the houselights followed me and the darkness
wept around me—and they were my sorrow.
</p>

<p>
But there on the distant verge, where the night sinks exhausted into the
blood-red arms of the white monster leaping over the world again, I fell;
deep I fell.
</p>

<p>
Far into a hidden land where I lay hidden; hidden in a field of black
flowers that were threaded with purple veins and green floating like thin
worms about me.

Autumn Song
</h4>

<p class="noindent">
My heart scatters tears over the dark day. The dull silvered poplar
leaves float in the air like dead butterflies.
</p>

<p>
It is the autumn come again, speaking with its soft-tongued winds to
the trees and to me.
</p>

<p>
It is cold. I have lost my warmth. I have lost thee. And the autumn
has come again to tell me of it.
</p>

<p>
Listen to the sad-tongued winds. See the storm faltering in the street.
It is cold.
</p>

<p>
It is the autumn come again, the autumn in whose wild sad treasures
we once laughed; once when your hot hands reached out to me like a
bright cry mocking the somber lisping of the twilight season.
</p>

<p>
Where are the songs I sang, the songs that leaped out of flame? Do
they echo still in your listening ears? Do they fall like warm tears in your
heart?
</p>

<p>
See the winds droop wearily into the trembling tree arms. See the
street grows pale. A dying panoply drifts across the grey-girthed sky.
</p>

<p>
Ho, Life, I have still a song for you. Though you come whispering to
me from the golden <a id="corr-0"></a>tombs of youth, from the scarlet graves of love, I will
make of the lament you bring me—music. I will make of the dull tears you
bring me—lyrics. I will clothe the grey ghosts of sorrow in rich trappings.
</p>

<p>
For it is only she who hath died. It is only she whom I loved with all
my soul. Though my heart scatter tears over the dark day they are the
tears of plenty. For her death hath enriched me.
</p>

<p>
For the autumn is come again speaking with its soft-tongued winds to
the trees and to me things I have never heard before; things that her white
breasts never told me; things that her burning lips never said to me; wild,
sad things that the flame from whence my songs once leaped never held
for me.
</p>

<p>
The dull silvered poplar leaves float in the air like dead butterflies, and
they are beautiful.

Death Song
</h4>

<p class="noindent">
Last night you came and sat by my bed in a little dark room and boasted
to me like a child.
</p>

<p>
“I have come to destroy the sun,” you said; “I will take the great,
yellow sun in my fingers and blow on it once and it will go out like a
match.”
</p>

<p>
And I wondered, because the sun is so large and hot, how such a little one
as you could blow it out like a match.
</p>

<p>
But you said: “I will blow once into the night and the stars will
sputter like little flames in a great wind and scatter away in ashes. And
the moon will spin around and around like a bright coin until it breaks into
little black bits.”
</p>

<p>
And I wondered because the night was so far, how such a little breath
as yours could reach into its soul.
</p>

<p>
But you said: “I will go out and touch the trees and the green leaves
will shrivel and the brown trunks will vanish. I will breathe just once on
the houses, the great big houses of iron and wood and stone, and they will
sway like long pieces of black cloth in the wind and they will melt into a
dark mist.”
</p>

<p>
And I wondered and wondered.
</p>

<p>
But you said: “In an instant I will walk up and down all the roads
you have known; I will wander in all the fields you have wandered and pass
through all the highways you have been. And each place that I move in
will cease to be. Under my feet the earth will become a powder and
vanish.”
</p>

<p>
Then you said, for I had ceased to wonder and was listening sadly:
“I will go to your beloved whose hair is like the silk on the corn and whose
eyes are like the deeps of the sea and I will smile on her and she will
become as nothing. She will become as a speck of dust and she will never
be again.”
</p>

<p>
And I wondered again how such a little one as you could make my
beloved into a speck of dust when she was so beautiful.
</p>

<p>
But you said: “I will touch all the faces you have seen with the point
of my finger and they will change into little dark clouds and I will blow
them away with the stars and the moon and the yellow sun.”
</p>

<p>
And I thought of all the faces you boasted to destroy and wondered—because
there were so many.
</p>

<p>
But you said: “Do you remember the little bird you saw hopping on
the stones in the park one day: I will go find the little bird and lay my
hand on her and she will never hop on the stones again.”
</p>

<p>
I remembered the little bird.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
And you said: “Do you remember the wide, green water that rolled
itself into a great colored ball and bounced up and down under the sun?
Listen—I will go and blow on the water and it will disappear into a single
drop. And I will bring this drop back to you to wear in your eyes when
they close.”
</p>

<p>
And I wondered and wondered.
</p>

<p>
But you said: “Listen:—there is an old woman who smiles when she
thinks of you. I will walk up behind her and touch her gently on the
shoulder and she will vanish.”
</p>

<p>
And I murmured, “Do not touch the old woman.”
</p>

<p>
But you said: “Listen:—I will lay my hand over all the wild notes
and sweet notes you have heard and they will be hushed. I will kill the
songs that lie unborn in the earth and the sea and the cherry trees and in
the white throats of birds and women and in the hearts of men.”
</p>

<p>
And I wondered how such a little one as you could hush so great a
chorus.
</p>

<p>
But you came closer to me and said: “I have come to destroy the
world for you, to pluck out every little blade of grass and every flower, to
brush away the stars and kick over the hills and tear up all the fields.”
</p>

<p>
It was dark in the little room where we were and I sighed.
</p>

<p>
And you came closer to me and said: “I will gather up in a great,
black bag everyone and everything and every God you have known and I
will drop them into a great, black hole. And listen:—and then you will be
alone.”

<h2 class="article" id="THEDIONYSIANDREISER">
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
The Dionysian Dreiser
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">heodore</span> Dreiser is the greatest novelist in America. It is not
a distinction. He has written poor novels. His latest novel, The
“Genius” published by John Lane Company is loose in parts. It limps.
It loses its breath. It grows thin. But it is a novel of sweep and magnitude,
of sledge hammer blows and fine chiseling. In the caramel chorus of America’s
chirping fictionists Dreiser raises the smooth, virile voice of an artist.
And there is no voice like his in America.
</p>

<p>
I prefer to write of what Dreiser has done in The “Genius” than to tell
in detail of what it is about. Calmly, aloofly with a consummate dispassion
Dreiser has thrust his magic pen home into the heart of American Puritanism.
God forgive him. God forgive the publishers. God forgive everybody
who reads the book and forgive me who write about it. For American
Puritanism is a sacred thing, as sacred as the gilt on the cathedral altar
places, as hallowed as the bathroom in a bawdy house. And Dreiser has
peeled off the gilt and ruthlessly thrust open the door. May he be cursed
with the wrath of an avenging public conscience. May he be made to wither
under the distinction of being a <a id="corr-2"></a>maniacal sensualist, a libidinous ruffian, a
lascivious distiller of corrupting langours. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Against the gray-dirt background, the shallow-hued smears of his
many contemporaries, Dreiser’s book stands forth like a red cry of truth.
It is not the book of a man enraged with the narrowness of a country, sputtering
against the insipidity of its composite ideals. Dreiser never descends
to the punitive hectoring of a Robert Herrick. Nor does he join the plaintive
assaults upon the pusillanimous conventions which characterize the “advanced”
fiction of the country. He does not make his men and women
vehicles for the antiquated day dream of brotherhood bosh. He does not
prostitute his work in dramatizing the current quibbles, marketing asinine
public convulsions in the literary capsules so commonly compounded by our
quack “creators.” All these things he does not do and if the reading public
of today will not reward him, the God of Dostoevsky, Flaubert, Huysmanns,
Shakespeare and Ambrose Bierce will.
</p>

<p>
What Dreiser does do is tell a straightforward story, tell it with all
the painstaking genius of the old Flemish painters. And he uses for his
background not the isolated strata of any single calling, but a country—your
world and mine and our neighbor’s. Life is greater than any of its
truths, sings Theodore Dreiser. There are many kinds of good, many kinds
of standards and many kinds of virtue. There is the virtue of farmer Blue,
the solid, masculine, clear and open virtue rooted in the laws of the land
and the rigmarole of society; thriving on the long, brown roads, the
ploughed fields and the homely beauties of existence. And there is the
virtue of Eugene Witla, the aesthetic, vibrating pursuit of beauty rooted in
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
the soul of the artist, thriving on the illusive lust of women, the intangible
urge of inspiration; spitting in the face of laws unnatural to it and the fallacies
that would be its fetters. Yes, says Dreiser, (I do not quote him), life
is a wide field bearing on its bosom beautiful flowers that do not resemble
each other and that require widely different care and nourishment. To
think that such commonplaces should be distinctive notes in the art of a
country! But they are. If you have read these things into novels before
you have not read them into American novels. I do not recall a single hero
in American fiction, who is not a Puritan, who does not suffer when he
sins, whom the indulgence of his desire for women does not inspire to repentance
and “reform” and success as the blue literary laws of America
demand. For further particulars on this general subject see Mr. Mencken’s
fulmination in last month’s Smart Set.
</p>

<p>
On this broad canvas of thought it is that Dreiser works. In his
new novel he begins in a little town in Illinois. Out of the midst of a mediocre
family living in the concentric provincialism of the middle west he
launches his young hero Witla—a lad suffering from dreams and stomach
trouble and a vague distinguishing unrest. His types are masterpieces.
His style, shorn of pretentious reticence or rhetorical pomp, is the painstaking
and poetical diction he revealed in Jennie Gerhardt. But he is not infallible.
There are sentences, paragraphs which jar. Although his strokes in delineating
character and situation are swift and certain, his language often
seems lame, his words watery, his phrases trite. But these are as the flaws
of a panoramic pen crowded at moments to a point of impatience and not
the faults of a weak writer. The effect is untouched. His people breathe
out of the pages. They are personalities. From beginning to end Dreiser
reveals a psychology of character amazing in its range and detachment.
Witla as a boy lives in Alexandria, Illinois. Dreiser traces the development
of his soul and sex and struggle out of the blanketing bourgois of his birthplace.
The young ’Gene answers the call of beauty, without knowing what
it is that calls him. He comes to Chicago. He is a laundry wagon driver,
a collector for an installment furniture house, a student of the old Art Institute,
a worker in the art department of a newspaper. Dreiser traces
him out of the half way stratas of Chicago to New York, to success, and
then through a labyrinth of incidents all interesting and big. He follows
him through one development after another until Witla, the painter, realizes
himself. I cannot begin to tell what the book is about. It is partially a
depiction of the struggle between an artist husband and a “good woman”
who is his wife, partly the struggle between the flesh and the spirit of the
same husband and the tale of their final adjustment. It is an Odyssey of a
type of man in whom the future of the arts rest as they always have rested.
In the 736 pages there are persons of every type. You will meet everyone
you have known and many you have dreamed of knowing. Every shade
of womanhood flashes between the covers. It is as a novel should be—complete.
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
It tingles with the quick spasmodic life of the city, of the country,
the factory, the field, the drawing room. And above all, it breathes the
atmosphere of America’s art life, the lively, struggling workers of the studio.
</p>

<p>
Witla, however, remains Dreiser’s calm, masterful argument against
the one-sided perversions of the Puritan. Witla is a genius. What are you
going to do with him, you proselyting blue stocking? Such a detached study
in perfidious polygamy is enough to damn the very printers who set the
type for the book. Here is a man of strong ideals, great productive talent,
an indispensable contributor to life, who naively considers setting up an
establishment for his pretty model just after he has proposed matrimony to
the woman he loves at the time with all the finest desires of his nature; a
miserable fellow who ruins and ravishes without compunction every shapely
creature who crosses his path. He is without even unconscious morality,
innate morality. Woman is beauty when she is anything and to possess
beauty is the motive force in his life. His eye possesses the beauty of the
city’s filth and dirt, the beauty of landscape, his mind possesses the beauty
of books and talk and other minds, and his body the beauty of passion wherever
he encounters it. Logical, natural, primitive and entirely artistic. But
immoral? God, yes. No one woman can satisfy a man unless he deliberately
stunts himself, is the Dreiserian Gospel. A man needs blonde women,
brunette women, short ones and tall ones, radical ladies and conservative
creatures—that is, a man like Witla does. And is Witla a supreme type, a
distinctive Sanine sort of fellow? Not a bit of it. Whether Dreiser thought
he is, I don’t know. He doesn’t say. But he isn’t. He is man and not
artist in his “sins.”
</p>

<p>
There is naturally more color to his escapades, to his “pursuit of beauty,”
for he is the “genius” with an eye to shades and a soul for nuances not possessed
by his more hum drum brothers. To him matrimony is naturally a
pit, a degradation, a series of cages, for he is the eternal masculine. But
how many men are there who have always been faithful to their wives?
What? I do not know of a single one. In his high lighted type of Witla,
Dreiser tells of this rudely, brutally and beautifully—with the indifference
of a Juggernaut and the cunning of a magician.
</p>

<p>
Really, you of the firm-fireside-faith, what is there to be done? Here
is the Dionysian dastard who dares proclaim that life is a decent, orderly
routine and that life is also a wild, warm passionate thing; that it is also a
flame in which there is only one color, the red, golden color of youth.
</p>

<p>
And the answer is—howl. A howl will go up, I swear it. It will start
from the critics.
</p>

<p>
I can almost read their forthcoming reviews as I close my eyes.
</p>

<p>
“A sensually depraved and degenerate type.”
</p>

<p>
“Striking at the bed rock of public solidarity, of home happiness, of
everything decent and worth while.”
</p>

<p>
And America’s reading public—“Horrible, filthy.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
Howl, you who have stultified your artists and buried them under the
gingerbread morality of your own monotonous lives. Dreiser is the one
novelist being published in America today who doesn’t listen to you, who
describes you at your various bests, who wrings the pathos and joys out of
your little worlds; who paints in with the brush of a universal art what you
and I are doing in Alexandria and Chicago and New York and all the milk-station
stops between.
</p>

<p>
I am not a disciple of the Dreiserian Gospel. I would like to argue
with him the certain superiorities of monogamy for the artist. But he has
limned a hero who is not a sugar-coated moralizer. He has ignored superbly
the mob-begotten mandates of literary excellence. Whatever his faults of
composition or construction, and there are not so many as his friends endeavor
to make out there are, he has magnificently booted the reading public, the
morally subsidized critics and the very publishers in the coarsest regions of
their bodies—their souls.
</p>

<p>
And for these things I hail him as the greatest novelist in the country.
I acclaim him as the only real, uncontaminated genius of these States and
pray to God that my friend Sherwood Anderson will hurry up and get published
so that there will be two of them.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">O</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> the play-grounds. The pretty girl and I withdrew from the noisy
festival to the desolate fountain. It was too hot to think, so I merely
talked.
</p>

<p>
An old, ragged, grey-bearded, gibbous Jew, with a basket over his arm,
was slowly approaching us.
</p>

<p>
The meaningless eyes of the pretty girl clouded.
</p>

<p>
“<a id="corr-6"></a>Peddlers are not allowed on the grounds. He must have sneaked in.”
</p>

<p>
The Jew stood at our side. He said nothing, but his timid eyes
appealed.
</p>

<p>
It was too hot to think, but for a moment I thought that a waft of
eternity breathed upon me from out the sad, timid eyes, and from out the
folds of the soiled old coat, and from out the clotty grey beard of the
descendant of Isaiah and the Maccabees.
</p>

<p>
“I shall buy some peaches, yes?”
</p>

<p>
The pretty girl twitched her little nose.
</p>

<p>
“But they are dusty.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no. See, they are covered.”
</p>

<p>
The sad, timid eyes smiled at me. I looked into the depth of those
eyes-of-ages. A half frivolous notion passed through my mind: I raised
the fruit, and pronounced the ancient Hebrew blessing:
</p>

<p>
“<em>Barukh atah, Adonay, elohenu melekh haolam, bore pri haetz.</em>”
(Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, creator of the fruit of the tree.)
</p>

<p>
The sad eyes became faintly radiant and moist. A suggestion of a
smile appeared around the hairy mouth. The lips mumbled something inaudible.
A lean brown hand rubbed the glossy side of the coat, and
tremblingly extended to me. I grasped it, embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
“<em>Lange Johren magt Ihr hoben, lange Johren auf Euch!</em>” (Long
years may you have, long years unto you!)
</p>

<p>
I turned to the pretty girl. With her handkerchief she was diligently
rubbing off a drop of juice from her white blouse.
</p>

<p>
It was too hot to think, so I resumed our playful talk.

II. Nocturne
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
It was night, and soft and blue and starry. A uniformed nurse emerged
from the dark alley of the park, and heavily dropped on the bench where
I sat. For some time she leaned backward, her eyes closed, her breast
heaving, her mouth half open. Then she looked widely, straightened herself,
sighed deeply, and casually glanced at me and at my box of paints.
</p>

<p>
“Are you an artist?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. Obviously, you are a nurse?”
</p>

<p>
She nodded, and burst forth into a rapid talk, as if she had long been
waiting for an opportunity to unburden herself.
</p>

<p>
“Just got off duty. See those lighted windows across the road? That
is our hospital. Ah, I shan’t stand it much longer. Moans and groans,
suffering, tears, madness—God! You know, it starts at twilight. As soon
as the sun sets all the miseries get loose. Even the quiet patients become
delirious and raise bedlam. And so till midnight. It will drive me insane.
Give me a cigarette, will you? There is nobody around at this time.”
</p>

<p>
Her “shop talk” bored me. Silently I gave her a cigarette and a light,
and watched her inhaling the smoke eagerly and intently. Her grey striped
dress with the tight white apron outlined a light, slender body, a supple
breast, and full strong arms. Her face was in the shadow, but my professional
eyes noticed its lovely oval contours. The little white cap seemed
toyishly small on the vast mass of disobedient hair. She flung away the
cigarette, and turned to me:
</p>

<p>
“Thanks, stranger. Why don’t you say something? Ah, what a night!
See the blue mist away there beneath the trees, and see that big oak—it’s
like a tower. Gee, I am getting romantic. Ah, what a night!”
</p>

<p>
I was amused with her half bookish, half street-talk. Somehow she
did not irritate me, as the rest of the people did, with her trivial remarks
on things which I believed to belong exclusively to the realm of colors
and music.
</p>

<p>
“Look!” She grasped my hand. “See the star falling? There, it
dropped into the lagoon. Ah, I smell hyacinths, do you? Hey, if you are
not going to say something, I’ll smash you!”
</p>

<p>
She snatched off my hat, threw it high up in the air, and, laughing
loudly, ran away, dropping her cap on the grass. I picked it up, and pursued
her. She was a swift runner, and we raced a long while across the
wide lawn before I caught her. In the dim bluish light she stood at my
side, a savage figure with stormy cascades of hair over her face and shoulders,
with flashing eyes, open mouth, dilating nostrils. In my professional
delight (I never lose my self-consciousness) I seized her by the waist and
lifted her up above me. She waved her good arms and shrieked in joy,
tossing her Medusa-head, arching her tense chest, quivering in ecstacy.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
“Hey, there. Cut that out!”
</p>

<p>
A husky policeman on a motorcycle approached us. He dismounted,
looked at us (I was still holding her in the air), and burst into a hoarse
guffaw.
</p>

<p>
“Well, I’ll be.... Beat it now. It’s improper.”
</p>

<p>
I handed her the mussed white cap. She twisted it with her fingers,
and her lips muttered somnolently:
</p>

<p>
“And at six thirty in the morning I must be on duty....”

III. Will to Power
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
At a crossing line on a Saturday night about 2 A. M. Tired men,
women, children, families, couples, waiting for a street car. Some lean
towards the wall, some sit on the sidewalk, on the garbage-box, on the curb.
Dull silence. The June night rolls on indifferently.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the calm is disturbed by violent screams and oaths. A
woman is hurled out by invisible hands from the corner-hotel. She crosses
the street towards the waiting crowd, staggers, waves her big handbag,
and swears hideously.
</p>

<p>
No response. The ennui on the faces remains unstirred. The coarse
solo of the prostitute, who ejaculates fantastically ugly verbs, nouns, adjectives,
bespatters the velvet night.
</p>

<p>
A baggy figure in a battered derby rises from the sidewalk, and hesitatingly
accosts the woman.
</p>

<p>
“You stop this noise....” Then threateningly: “Want to take a
ride?”
</p>

<p>
Her foul flux interrupted, the woman thrusts her red face into the
man’s, and hisses half coquettishly, half contemptuously:
</p>

<p>
“A ride? With you, sweetheart? Sure!”
</p>

<p>
He grabs her by the shoulder. His face grows pale.
</p>

<p>
“Come on, now. Move on, I tell you!”
</p>

<p>
The woman shrieks and struggles.
</p>

<p>
“Let go! Look what he is doing to me! Who are you? You are not
a detective.... Let go!”
</p>

<p>
The crowd does not stir. Some one yawns desperately. A little boy
whimpers, and clings to his dozing mother.
</p>

<p>
The man drags his shrieking victim. He pulls out a chain of keys,
and swings it triumphantly. The woman screams and hits her assailant on
the face with her heavy handbag. New figures appear from the adjoining
streets. A voice is heard:
</p>

<p>
“Maybe he is not a detective.... Hey, where’s your star?”
</p>

<p>
The man’s pale face twitches convulsively. The woman feels encouraged,
strikes him short, rapid blows, and shouts wildly:
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
“He is not a detective! Look what he is doing to me!”
</p>

<p>
A big fist plunges into the man’s face. He gasps, and falls. When
he rises, a shower of fists meets him. Many of the erstwhile indifferent
figures are now up, eager to lay a hand on the imposter. Like a toy, he falls
and rises, looking astonished, in a trance.
</p>

<p>
The long-awaited car suddenly plunges into the imbroglio. Men,
women, children, push and justle at the narrow entrance.
</p>

<p>
The man stands alone, hatless, wiping a bleeding face with his sleeve,
muttering faintly:
</p>

<p>
“I am a detective.... I am.”
</p>

<p>
The night rolls on indifferently.

The Truth

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> truth, my friend? There is no truth. It is impossible for the human
mind to attain the truth. You can tell the truth with reservations,
with omissions. Perhaps you can speak the truth that is only part truth.
Yes, that is often done by virtuous people and by clever people. But to
speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, to place your
soul naked before either God or man,—that, my friend, is impossible. I
have listened to women lie. Sometimes it is only necessary to watch. And
it is the same with a man.
</p>

<p>
What? A man will tell the truth before God? You are quite wrong.
A man will lie to himself and he will lie to his God. I know. I listened to
a man lie to God. I will tell you the story.
</p>

<p>
The man’s name was Henry Spencer. You perhaps remember it. He
was a murderer. One of his victims was a tango teacher named Mrs.
Allison Rexroat. When the body of Mrs. Rexroat was found behind a
clump of bushes in a lonely spot the police somehow blundered upon a
clew. In four days they traced the murder of the woman to Henry Spencer.
They wove a net of evidence about him. Oh they are clever, sometimes, my
friend. On the fifth day Henry Spencer sat in the police captain’s office and
they sweated him. After five hours he confessed. Ordinarily this means
nothing. I have seen criminals confess to crimes of which they were innocent.
Sweating is an unintelligent process, but then criminals are unintelligent
persons and for a stupid mind the whole affair becomes quite an ordeal.
The police captain says, “You did.” The criminal replies, “I didn’t.” It is
very simple, my friend, but very wearing; particularly when there are five
policemen to say “You did,” and none but yourself to say “I didn’t.” But
it happened this time that the policemen blundered upon a real confession.
After five hours Henry Spencer jumped to his feet and shouted, “Yes, I
did. I killed her.” He was led away. Two days later he repeated his confession
and elaborated on it. He sketched the murder, described the events
leading up to it.
</p>

<p>
The policemen, highly elated, rushed out and verified all he had said.
They found the hammer he told them he had used where he said he had
thrown it. They found the effects of the murdered woman where he said he
had hidden them. Henry Spencer went to trial. A number of attorneys
defending him pleaded insanity. Spencer upset their efforts by rising in
the court room and informing the jury he was quite sane and that he had
committed a number of murders in his life. Given permission by the court
he informed them that his life had been an extremely illegal one. He
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
named five women he had killed. The police, highly elated, rushed out and
verified his statements. In concluding, the defendant again sought to impress
them with the fact that he was quite sane and willing to pay the
penalty for his crimes. In fact several times he cried out from his seat,
“Hurry up and hang me.”
</p>

<p>
You will argue, my friend, that there was an instance where in the very
depravity of his nature a man attained the naked truth. You are quite
wrong. Henry Spencer killed the women he said he killed, but he failed
of the truth. For three months he had sat in his cell figuring the thing out.
He came to the conclusion that by telling truthfully of his crimes and pleading
truthfully of his sanity he would create the impression that he was
indeed a maniac. You see, it is quite simple. Lies are always simple. It is
only the truth which is impossible to understand. Henry Spencer’s logic
proved accurate. He convinced the jury that he was a maniac. But he had
placed too much faith on the technical interpretation of the law. The jury
sentenced him to hang, anyway. So did the judge.
</p>

<p>
The date was set and Henry Spencer waited in the jail of a little town
in Illinois. It is the duty of a large number of people in the world to save
souls from Hell. Do not think I speak sarcastically, my friend. There is
nothing wrong in this, except, of course, its utter futility. For two months
the Rev. Mr. Williams, his wife, and his son visited Henry Spencer daily in
his cell. They taught him religion. The doomed man was an illiterate. He
had been brought up in the streets. He spoke English vulgarly and he
understood nothing. His mind was unformed and his ideas of any particular
life to be were as vague as his ideas of the life that was.
</p>

<p>
So he became religious. This is quite a story in itself, his acquiring
“faith.” They played hymns in his cell on an old melodeon. Each night the
Williams family knelt with him and prayed. He found in the Scriptures
and their promise something that stilled the cold terror of death. His
nerves became quiet. In fact he became buoyant. You will say it is impossible
for a man to acquire genuine faith under such circumstances. You
are quite wrong, my friend. I will prove it to you soon.
</p>

<p>
On the day preceding his execution Henry Spencer exhibited the only
bit of nervousness during his watch for death. He objected to the big clock
that hung in the corridor outside his cell. He didn’t like the way it ticked.
You know why. So they removed the clock. How kind people are to those
whom they are about to destroy. They quite resemble the Gods in the
matter.
</p>

<p>
I am coming now to the point of the story, so be patient, my friend.
It was a sunny morning in early July. Inside a stockade they had erected
a scaffold. During the night Henry Spencer sang hymns. The sheriff sat
on the doorstep of his home adjoining the jail listening and looking at the
moon and greasing a hempen rope with cold cream which he borrowed
from his daughter. He was a religious man and the hymns made him sad.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
At ten o’clock the death march started from Spencer’s cell. Now there
were thirty-eight steps leading to the top of the scaffold which rose high
above the stockade top. I know this because a young man named Smith and
I walked up the steps the midnight before and counted them. After counting
them I made a wager with the young man that Spencer would never reach
the top unsupported. So I was exceedingly interested when the death march
entered the stockade. A number of persons were privileged to march in the
line, and the first to appear was Spencer. He was dressed as if he were
hurrying to a tennis game—white trousers, white shoes, a soft white collar,
and a white shirt. On the pocket of his shirt he had pinned a red carnation.
He walked with a light, springy step. Behind him trailed the Rev.
Mr. Williams and the others.
</p>

<p>
Henry Spencer wore a good-natured smile on his face. When he
reached the bottom step of the scaffold I held my breath. I watched him
skip nimbly up the stairs, never missing a step, never tripping or hesitating.
Under more virtuous circumstances the thing would have passed for heroism.
At any rate I lost the wager.
</p>

<p>
Spencer stood on the scaffold, the noose hanging over his shoulder.
The smile had not left his face. Several hundred necks were craned towards
him. I would have felt chilled to see so many necks at such a time had I
been he. The sheriff and his assistant began dressing him in a white robe
that covered him from the neck down.
</p>

<p>
He commenced talking at once.
</p>

<p>
“My friends,” he said, extending his arm. They strapped it to his side
as he did so but he continued unflustered. “I am glad of the opportunity
this gives me of telling you that for the first time in my life I am happy.
I have found a mother and a God and a friend while I have been in jail
waiting for death. Although it is going to cost me my life I am glad I am
here to tell you this. I have repented for my sins. I have made my peace
with my God and my fellow men. And I am happy, my friends, happy. I
have found a mother who has shown me the way to peace and salvation.
I am grateful to Him for the gladness he has put in my heart. Oh, my
friends—”
</p>

<p>
He raised his head to the sky. Standing against the sun in his white
robe, his face transfigured with a wonderful smile, he looked like some
Crusader giving himself into the arms of the Virgin. Above him stretched
the green leafy branch of a tree that rustled faintly in the breeze. A little
bird sat on a twig and chirped. And still above stretched the pure blue
sky with its white fleece clouds. Henry Spencer looked at it all—life, the
little bird, the sky, the green leaves—and smiled; smiled as I have never
seen a man smile before.
</p>

<p>
They strapped his ankles and then the sheriff adjusted the rope around
his neck with great care. His political future was dependent on his task.
Spencer resumed talking.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
He recited two long psalms with never a wrong word, and I who had
listened to him five months ago sat astounded. His voice, his accent, everything
about him had changed. A theologian could have rendered the psalms
no more accurately. Then he looked at the sky again. I felt that before his
eyes the clouds rolled away and God revealed himself, a gigantic figure
seated on a golden throne. I felt that he saw the cherubs and the angels
he had read of in the scriptures, perceived the jewelled streets and the
harpists and Christ waiting with outstretched arms and forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, my friends,” he went on, “I am not afraid, for I have given myself
to Christ, pure in spirit, strong in faith.” He quoted from the Bible.
“See, I smile at it all, for believe me, O Lord, I am happy.” The sheriff
had lifted the white hood to the man’s head and was beginning to adjust it.
The smile never left his face, the light that blazed from his eyes never
dimmed. “I am going to heaven,” he said as they settled the hood on his
head, “and I want to say only one more thing before I go. My friends, as
I stand here, I tell you I am innocent of the murder of Mrs. Allison Rexroat.”
</p>

<p>
And they hanged him.
</p>

<p>
The truth? The human ego is too weak for truth. What do you say,
my friend?

</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> Clamecy, a quiet town in Nivernais in Central France, Romain Rolland
was born in 1866. His family had dwelt for centuries in the little
place, both as country folk and townspeople. Quite contrary to the inference
one would draw from <em>Jean Christophe</em>, neither German nor other foreign
ancestry is discoverable in the family lineage; Rolland is descended
from pure French Catholic burgher stock. His parents devoted themselves
with loving zeal to his education; his mother endowing him with a musical
sense and love of music that made music, from earliest childhood, his passion
and joy; his father, a notary in Clamecy, gave up his profession that he
might accompany his young son to Paris.
</p>

<p>
It is not the external events of his life, but the spiritual atmosphere and
environment of his native town, that Rolland depicted in the sixth part of
<em>Jean Christophe</em>, under the sub-title, “Antoinette.” The landscape of Nivernais
is a mingling of rivers and canals, great forests and Mont de Moran’s
peaks. The region unites memorials of the Keltic and Gallic-Roman times
and cathedrals of the Gothic period, stimulating the historical sense which,
next to the sense of music, is most characteristic of Romain Rolland.
</p>

<p>
He entered the <em>Ecole Normale superieure</em> in Paris, when about fifteen
or sixteen years of age, and later went to the <em>Academia di Francia</em> in Rome.
He considers the friendship formed there with Malvida von Meysenburg<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-1" id="fnote-1">[1]</a>
profoundly significant in his development. As she was a faithful friend of
Mazzini and Herzen, of Wagner and Nietzsche, in middle age, so in her old
age she was the friend of Romain Rolland. “Her memory is sacred to me,”
he recently wrote, and he had continued in regular correspondence with her
from 1890 until her death in 1903.
</p>

<p>
Rome exercised a profound influence upon his entire spiritual life. He
spent there the years 1889 and 1890, and has since made frequent visits for
longer or shorter periods. Italy is the country which, next to France, he
knows best and loves most. Germany, on the other hand, which he has
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
described in <em>Jean Christophe</em> so vividly that one is convinced he must have
passed a great part of his life there, he knows only through some minor
journeys.
</p>

<p>
In 1895, he received his doctor’s degree at the University of Paris, and
presented two theses.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-2" id="fnote-2">[2]</a> He was, first, instructor in the History of Art at
the school he had attended; later he became professor of History of Music
at the Sorbonne, a position he will probably resign; partly, because an automobile
accident injured his arm so that he can no longer illustrate his lectures
on the History of Music with the piano; partly, because he has found
the combination of authorship and lectures too great a strain upon his delicate
health.
</p>

<p>
Concerning the literary impressions that were decisive in his development,
he says that his education, like that of most young Frenchmen, was
founded upon the classics of the seventeenth century. He found his way,
himself, to the writers who gave him spiritual sustenance: Shakespeare,
Goethe, and the Encyclopedists, especially Diderot.
</p>

<p>
In 1886, along with his school comrades, he became acquainted with
Tolstoy. In his book on Tolstoy, Rolland says, “He was the purest light
that illumined our youth, the cheering star in the twilight of the end of the
century—our only real friend in contemporary European art.” It was Tolstoy’s
intoxicating adoration of life that enraptured the young Frenchmen
as well as the young Northerners. It was the realism in Tolstoy’s art that
“opened the portals to life”; it was the mysticism in Tolstoy’s nature that
opened their ears to “the music of the soul for which they longed” ...
“Tolstoy was to our generation what Werther was to the youth of the
eighteenth century.”
</p>

<p>
“But,” wrote Rolland in a letter, “the most potent influence in my life
was and continues to be—music. It has been an ever-flowing spring, not
only for my emotional life, but also for the interpretation of life. For, to
him who can rightly listen, music is a language that can interpret the subtlest
emotions of the soul, and reveal manifold secrets which literature has never
been able to express. If in any degree I understand the German soul, it is
due to music.”
</p>

<p>
Romain Rolland is familiar, alike, with the old German masters of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and with those of most recent times.
<em>Jean Christophe</em>, the world’s greatest novel concerning a musician and
music, is therefore written by a thoroughly-trained connoisseur and practitioner
of music; a man who demonstrates that, for his own and for his
hero’s individual culture, music is the most profound determining influence.
</p>

<p>
Even though Romain Rolland differs from Tolstoy in questions pertaining
to his conception of music, still it is in Tolstoy’s spirit that he glorifies
in this form of art its universal breadth, its power—beyond national boundaries
and personal limitations—to unite mankind in and through the joy of
beauty, which is one of the highest conditions of the soul.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
One aspect of Romain Rolland’s literary work is a direct expression of
his profound belief in the ethical mission of art. He participated ardently
in the movement, instituted at the close of the last century, that purposed
to educate the workingman by means of elevated amusements, especially
plays. But Rolland did not, like Tolstoy, seek to awaken love of mankind;
he wanted to strengthen power of action and heroism. Rolland has recently
published the second edition of a book in which he has collected his controversial
articles, written at the time when he and a group of friends hoped
to create a new theatre for the awakening people, and thus contribute to the
encouragement of that energy of action necessary to the solution of the great
problems the time presents.
</p>

<p>
Pleasure, enlightenment, energy, says Rolland, are what the theatre
should furnish the people. Neither the classic drama, which bores the workingman
to death by presenting to him <em>les parties mortes de l’ame</em>, nor the
present drama, which injures or lowers him by setting him in a fever of
sordid passions, is fit for a people’s theatre. It must furnish the best drama
of the present time, the spectacle in which the serious aspect of the time is
reflected, or scenes from those earlier phases in which the spirit of struggle
and of devotion lived; in other words, it must furnish a virile and wholesome
art.
</p>

<p>
The heroes of the French Revolution were Rolland’s inspiration for the
drama, and he utilized the struggles of the time of the Revolution for spectacles
and folk festivals. At that time he wrote and produced for the people’s
theatre: <em>Le 14 Juillet</em>, <em>Danton</em>, <em>Les Loups</em>, <em>Le triomphe de la raison</em>. The
last he has recently published, together with two other early dramas, <em>St.
Louis</em> and <em>Aërt</em>. They are all, as he himself says, devoted to religious enthusiasm;
for God, for country, for reason.
</p>

<p>
He wished to set these pictures of struggling devotion against the
cowardice of thought and cowardice of will that he saw everywhere around
him. He voiced his own sentiment and that of his young kindred spirits
in the words of one of his heroes, who was condemned to death:
</p>

<p>
“Life will be what I will. I have anticipated victory, but I shall be
victorious.” And in the words of another:
</p>

<p>
“You are always thinking of what you can keep or lose. Only think
of what you can give. Live; be like the water that flows.... The
world would not exist without that happiness of beings, of flowers in the
sun, that joy of giving one’s life to the point of exhaustion—which is also
a joy of dying continually!”
</p>

<p>
“It is elder brother to Jean Christophe,” Rolland says, “less robust but
not less faithful,” who uttered these words, which comprise Rolland’s creed
in its most succinct formula.
</p>

<p>
To revive the energy of action of the French Revolution in order to
continue thus the work interrupted in 1794; to set in motion the great
passions, not for the purpose of arousing chauvinistic or revolutionary
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
fanaticism, but in order to kindle anew the universal feeling of solidarity—this
was the hope of Rolland and his friends for the future of France.
</p>

<p>
“This hope,” he says, “was one of the purest and holiest forces in our
young lives.” Rolland, therefore, calls his <em>Théâtre du peuple</em> a document of the
time, because it “reflects the artistic ideas and hopes of a whole generation.”
</p>

<p>
He gives voice now (1913) to that proud utterance: “Let the future
judge us even should it prove that it was our crime to have believed too
much in the future.”
</p>

<p>
That this little group has not yet been victorious, we know. Romain
Rolland indicated the reason when he said: “In order to fashion a theatre
for the people, we must <em>first have a people</em>; a people with a <em>freedom of the
soul</em> able to enjoy art; a people with <em>leisure</em>; a people not oppressed by misery
or incessant toil; a people not brutalized by every superstition and
fanaticism from right and left; a people lord over itself and victor in the
battle fought out from day to day.”
</p>

<p>
To these utterances of 1903 can be added one of this year, in which
Rolland expressed himself most fervently and with comprehension in regard
to the working class of <em>women</em>—and in that connection in regard to the
whole woman question.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-3" id="fnote-3">[3]</a> It was made evident, then, that the idealist Rolland
is no advocate of the chauvanistic-religious reaction. His idealism is
of the whirl of revolutionary times and the future.
</p>

<p>
His critique upon the classic French literature, his “Teutonism” in <em>Jean
Christophe</em>, his political and religious radicalism, have made him as obnoxious
to nationalistic-Catholic France as Mme. de Stael once was because
of her <em>De l’Allemagne</em>. Among other evidences of Rolland’s status in his
own country is the circumstance that when the French Academy recently
awarded its new prize of 10,000 francs, it was given, through the influence
of Maurice Barrès, to a wholly new man in French literature: André Lafon
du Blaye, instructor in a Catholic private school, who had written a book
about a school boy, a book which was found to possess that “elevated character”
the awarding of the prize demanded! <em>Jean Christophe</em> had just been
finished! It is, however, not merely in academic circles that Romain Rolland
is denied recognition. He has succeeded in getting himself well hated in
many another circle because of the cutting truths in <em>Jean Christophe</em>, directed
against all factions. In <em>Ord och Bild</em>, 1912, George Brandes has
given a brief but excellent characterization of Rolland’s spiritual and intellectual
endowments and of his limitations.
</p>

<p>
Without doubt Rolland’s spiritual tendency in youth was determined
not only by Tolstoy but also by Guyau; the more because Tolstoy has Guyau
to thank for whatever of reason is found in his theories of art.
</p>

<p>
In regard to the influence of Guyau upon Tolstoy and Nietzsche, see,
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
for example, Professor Albert Nilson’s excellent essay upon <em>Guyau’s
Aesthetics</em>.
</p>

<p>
In the mind of Rolland as well as of Guyau, the ethical ideal is the
highest intensive quality of life, the most effective energy. Rolland is far
from the Christian asceticism that diluted the wine of Tolstoy. But along
with Tolstoy, with Guyau, with Nietzsche, he demands an art that possesses
life’s consummate vigor; that is itself the richest life, the highest intensity
of power. In other words: the ethical ideal and the aesthetic are at heart
the same thing; the fundamental principle of art and religion is solidarity;
the sense of beauty is at the same time the most intensive and the most expansive
of feelings, and so—like the love of humanity—the great fraternizing
power. “They who love most create most richly,” and “the work that
reveals to us the life of greatest value is the noblest”: these propositions
permeated Rolland just as they did Guyau and Tolstoy, although Rolland
establishes a basis of valuation quite different from that of the latter. Perhaps
Bergson, too, has in some respects confirmed Rolland’s personal view
of life. But as Rolland’s view was enunciated before Bergson began to
write, the influence could have been only to strengthen, not to determine it.
No idea harmonized better with Rolland’s own innermost being than that
respecting the power of the spirit to make a way for creative, unfathomable,
inexhaustible life. <em>Jean Christophe</em>, from the first chapter to the last, is an
illustration of this explosive power, this <em>élan vital</em>.
</p>

<p>
Schiller’s words come to mind: Der Dichter ist der einzige wahre
<em>Mensch</em> und der beste Philosoph ist nur eine Karikatur gegen ihn.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-4" id="fnote-4">[4]</a> The
poet is the only real <em>Man</em> and the best philosopher is only a caricature beside
him.
</p>

<p>
Not only with his dramas of the Revolution did Romain Rolland endeavor
to make his countrymen hero-worshippers; he also began a series
of popular biographies aimed to present, not the great man’s work, but the
personal powers and experiences that found expression in his work. He
says in the preface: “Europe is poisoned with materialism and egotism;
we must throw open the windows to get air: <em>Respirons le souffle des heros.
Let us breathe the breath of heroes.</em>” He rejoices that he too has witnessed
contemporary heroic deeds: the defense of the Boers and the vindication of
Dreyfus. But he knows that it is “easier to kindle enthusiasm by heroes of
the past,” heroes “who were great in heart.”
</p>

<p>
His hero-worship did not lead him, however, to glorification at the expense
of truth. He utters the thought, profoundly true and all too little
understood, that every lack of harmony between life and its laws depends—even
in great spirits—not upon their greatness, but upon their weaknesses.
“But these weaknesses render them not less worthy of our love....
The idealism that will not recognize the truth is cowardice; there is only one
heroism in the world: <em>to see the world as it is—and to love it</em>.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
So without hesitation, Rolland points out weaknesses in Michael Angelo’s
life, and inconsistencies in Tolstoy’s. He sees in both great specimens
of the “type that will pass away”; the Christian—those who “have had their
refuge in God and the everlasting life when this life has gone against them;
those whose faith has often been expression for deficient belief in life, in the
future, in themselves; a lack of courage and a lack of gladness.” “I know,”
he continues, “of how many defeats your grievous victories are made, and
therefore I pity you and admire you. You make the world more doleful
but more beautiful. Praised be pain and praised be joy! Both are holy;
they form the world and they broaden great souls: joy and pain are powers,
are life, are God.”<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-5" id="fnote-5">[5]</a>
</p>

<p>
The three biographies that Rolland has thus far published are of Beethoven,
Michael Angelo, and Tolstoy. In the first, it is the love of life and
the courage of life; in the second, creative power and strength of belief;
in the third, the ecstacy of life and the love of mankind, that he emphasizes.
Such souls, he says, restore to us belief in life and in mankind, for from
them “issues a current of social power and potent goodness.”
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="II3">

<p class="noindent">
Beethoven is Rolland’s own conception of life, and is nearest his heart.
To that “soul of music, heroism, and goodness” Rolland has reared the
only memorial worthy of Beethoven that art has created: <em>Jean Christophe</em>.
</p>

<p>
This book was published during the course of nine years. But long
before it began to appear it had lived in and with its writer for the greater
part of his life. In it Rolland has committed to writing his profound conception
of the innermost being of a musical genius, and has done it in such
a manner that one is firmly convinced of the truth of the revelations that
one follows from the cradle to the grave. In other novels concerning geniuses
the writers assert incessantly that they <em>are</em> geniuses; here the genius
evinces himself through his being. One does not read a book, one lives a
life—and a life of the highest value, the existence that great spirit creates:
that of the genius, who out of the flaming chaos of his nature forms a cosmos.
An “educational novel,” of which the world’s literature thus far possesses
only one such in <em>Wilhelm Meister</em>, and, in a measure, in Keller’s <em>Der
<a id="corr-12"></a>Grüne Heinrich</em>.... I have lived more intensely with <em>Jean Christophe</em>
than with most living people.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-6" id="fnote-6">[6]</a>
</p>

<p>
World fame is a curious thing. Sometimes it is attained quickly
through glorifying friends: a path to fame that often early avenges itself,—that
is more dangerous even than the fame that the attacks of enemies furnish.
Sometimes fame is won with one blow, by an exceptional work; again
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
it is prepared for in silence and then suddenly rushes forth with the roar of
a great torrent formed by many small streams. The last is the case with Romain
Rolland.
</p>

<p>
When I read him in 1909, in Switzerland, I went shortly afterwards to
Paris, where, at that time, he was not mentioned among the celebrated writers
and where even his friends thought he dare not reckon his circle of readers
larger than the ten or fifteen thousand faithful he possessed in the world
of French-speaking readers. In Germany his circle was still narrower; in
Sweden, he was unknown even by name.
</p>

<p>
For the new generation the book is a document of the spiritual history
of the time. For the serious-minded portion of the French youth, Rolland
has possessed an influence comparable with his own description of Tolstoy’s
influence upon himself and the young generation with him. Youth has
learned from him that the fleeting fashionable attitude toward the great
souls or ideas that Paris shapes is sterile; that it is only by devotion that a
spiritual growth can be attained; that skepticism in the face of all greatness
is poverty, but admiration and love “is the way, to the most potent, the
richest, life.” Youth has found in him contempt for mere fine phrases, for
declamation, and received from him Goethe’s conception of creation: “In
the beginning was action.” They have heard him proclaim <em>that</em> nationalism
that is loyalty to the best in the essence of the French nation: love of truth
and justice, desire for freedom and fraternity, devotion to its ideal values
and above all the dream of happiness for all mankind. This dream that
among us Teutons is content to sleep, is among Frenchmen an ever restless
disturbance of the blood. And it is only by occasionally letting his blood
flow for these dreams that he feels he is living up to his highest ideals.
<em>This</em> Youth for whom each new part of <em>Jean Christophe</em> has been a great
event, despises with Rolland the estheticism that turns from life. This
youth has learned to distinguish between great art and the work of those
who think they are creating art but are only making arts. But above all,
at a time of reaction toward the Christian “faith”—a reaction that has been
justified by the fact that science has not been able to “explain” life nor
“vindicate” it—they receive a new fountain of living water. Rolland has
attempted neither to explain life nor defend it. The leit-motiv of his great
symphonic work is Beethoven’s thought: “Durch Leiden Freude,”—“Through
suffering joy comes.” We can, so he says, neither understand
life in all its plenitude of contradictions nor ennoble it in all its brutality in
any way other than by <em>living</em> it one’s self in the fullest and highest meaning
of the word. Music, the all-unifying art, love, the all-embracing condition
of the soul, are the two highest attitudes of devotion to God, who is life.
</p>

<p>
More Rolland knows not. And more than he knows the veracious man
does not say.
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
“I cannot,” he writes, “give any metaphysical credo. For,
in the first place, I will never deceive myself by saying <em>I know
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
that which I do not know</em>—which, at the most, I can imagine or
hope. In the second place, I will never confine myself within the
limits of any belief. For I hope to develop until my last day;
I wish to reserve for myself unlimited freedom of intellectual transformation
and renewal. I have many gods in my Pantheon; but my
chief godhead is <em>Liberty</em>. At present I do not separate the essence
of the human soul from that of the divine spirit, of which the
former is a part. But I hardly believe that this divine spirit fills
the universe. It <em>seeks</em>, certainly, to fill the world and guide it;
but nothing indicates that it will succeed. Even in this regard I
reserve space for liberty. Pure monism does not satisfy me. I
am more inclined to a dualism such as the ancient Empedocles
believed in. I have an unbounded admiration for the pre-Socratic
philosophers, the sages of Ionia and Magna Graecia. Indeed my
first work, written at Rome, twenty years ago, was a drama with
Empedocles as hero. The struggle between two principles is
manifest to me in the whole history of the world, material as
well as moral history. The question is whether there is not a
<em>third</em> principle, in which the other two are included or harmonized.
A trinity therefore—it is singular how this form forces
itself upon the human mind—but a trinity very different from the
Christian conception of the trinity, since it comprises a father
and two striving brothers: a triad that approaches the antique
cosmogony of which we find a reflection in Hesiod, in <em>Chaos</em>,
<em>Gaea</em>, and <em>Eros</em>. If I live I shall go deeper into ancient thought.
Those ancient philosophers lived in more intimate contact with
nature than any of their successors, and, moreover, collected the
thousand-year-old wisdom of the whole Orient.”
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Besides this personal utterance of Rolland himself, a French friend of
his, intimate with his thought, has given me permission to communicate the
following statement of the trend of Rolland’s thought:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
The liberty of his mind, his lucidity, his keen penetration,
render him incapable of accepting the least dogma or the least
constraint. It is impossible to conceive of anything that could
have upon such a mind, not to say a direct hold, but even an
appreciable influence. That mind is alone, magnificently alone,
as independent as if the world were just born. Moreover, he is
quite as far from all revealed religions as from all systems.
He would in no wise admit that the Christian or any other religion
is more closely related to the past, and Darwinism or any
scientism whatever more to the future. He would see, in these
diverse ways of viewing life, forms of the human mind which
return at periodic intervals and of which one no more than the
other is an absolute progress in which he does not believe. Only
by his very nature, he is antimaterialistic. He believes in the
duality of soul and body in an absolute, organic manner. He
hopes sincerely to quit this body and go to live a larger and
fuller life. No personal immortality! He cannot endure the
thought. That would be the continuation of this captivity in a
limited personality, which to him appears stifling. He feels that
he is also going to live in God, not understanding by that word
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
any anthropomorphic god, but a fountain of universal life. He
loves to plunge, through time and space, into a meditation in
which he totally forgets his personality, and wherein he finds a
sort of intoxication. He has uttered this admirable and terrible
sentence: “Sometimes I feel <em>no difference</em> between my friends
absent or present, living or dead.” To ask such a being if he is
of the past or of the future would have no significance; he is
beyond the compass of time.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
I have met Rolland only through letters. But some words concerning
his personality, as it had affected another poet, I can communicate here in
conclusion:
</p>

<p>
“The confident grasp replete with experience, the modest ripeness ...
in his being; the benignity, the unprecedented purity in all his purpose ...
are beneficent.... Everything is genuine, developed with will and
consciousness: a man who has improved steadily.... From him emanates
a gentle plenitude, consummate in action, like that of a star at twilight.”
</p>

<p>
When world renown comes to such a man, it has not much to say to
him. Rolland meets it with an averted glance in his far-seeing luminous
eyes, eyes which quietly and steadily look towards new works and new
horizons.
</p>

<p>
From all corners of the world he hears: that he has given to the time
the book most brimming with the whole seething life of the time; that he
has given men the book most permeated with the essence of music and
Orphean effects; that he has created an entire human race, a race in which
all ages of life and degrees of development, in which women as well as men
are equally convincing in truth to life; that he has given a work overflowing
with ideas, with philosophy of life, with vital help, by exhibiting a great
human life in all its weakness and in all its strength. And assuredly this
will give him joy.
</p>

<p>
But he will feel proud only when the word comes that his French heart
longs to hear: The people that has given to the world such a work is not,
as its enemies say, going to destruction. That nation is ever potent with
the energy of life.
</p>

<p>
Rolland’s great book is not merely a glorious revelation of the fact
that all the greatest ideas that France has given the world live ever in the
French people. It demonstrates also that mankind needs the French spirit
always in order to realize them.

A Glimpse at Russia
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">ars</span> have been the landmarks in Russian modern history. The
Napoleonic war was followed by the insurrection of the Decembrists,
the first attempt on the part of liberal Russia to break the autocracy. The
iron reign of Nicolas I culminated in the Crimean campaign, which revealed
the utter rottenness of the old order and necessitated the general reconstruction
of the estate, from the liberation of the serfs to the establishment of
jury-tribunals. The reaction under Alexander III and Nicolas II came to
a collapse with the Japanese war, more disastrous and richer in results than
Sebastopol. It may be interesting to notice that each of the mentioned
epochs followed the previous one at a space of about a quarter of a century,
and the fact that the present war broke out only ten years after the
last one may be interpreted as an attempt for self-correction on the part of
History. Both the war with Japan and the revolution that came as its
result were abortive and premature phenomena, and were destined “to be
continued.”
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to get an idea of what has occurred in Russia during
the last ten years in order to understand her present situation and perspectives.
The Russian people were neither prepared nor desirous of fighting
against Japan for the Yalou forests, a problem that interested only a group
of greedy capitalists. Nicolas was egged on by the Kaiser, who was more
than anxious to involve his neighbor in a mess in the Far East, and thus
to divert his attention from the Near East where the interests of the Triple
Alliance demanded the elimination, or at least the weakening, of the formidable
ally of France. The Czar caught the bait, and was rewarded with
the Treaty of Portsmouth, which put an end to Russia’s ambitions in Manchuria
and crippled her international prestige, to the immediate advantage
of Germany and Austria. The defeated bear was forcibly driven to introspection.
Her navy almost totally destroyed, her army decimated and demoralized,
her population torn by revolutions and civil warfare, Russia
faced a <a id="corr-13"></a>Herculean task. The government was confronted with a double
problem, to quench the internal conflagration, and to get ready for “retaliation.”
The first aim was more or less achieved; the revolutionists were
hanged, shot, imprisoned, exiled; the moderate elements and the European
financiers, who demanded a guarantee for their enormous loans, were hood-winked
by a semblance of parliamentarism, the butaforial Duma, an institution
elected and managed practically by the Czar’s ministers. With feverish
energy the government set out to carry through its second purpose.
The Dumas were forced to sanction gigantic war-budgets, and the entire
bureaucratic state was thrown into a crucible of radical, sweeping reforms.
The reconstruction of the army has become the all-important issue. Without
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
naming the potential enemy, all parties, except the Socialists, agreed
that Russia must concentrate her forces on the building up in the fastest
possible time of an enormous, efficient, <em>modern</em> army. The majority of the
people differed with the government, however, on one point, as to who
should carry out the great task. The people have had little confidence in
the capability of the bureaucracy for self-reformation; they have applied
to them the Russian saying, “Only the grave can change the hunchback.”
Alexander Guchkov, while president of the Duma and later as an influential
private citizen, has revealed the hopelessly rotten state of affairs in the
military and civil organization of the country, managed by unscrupulous
thieves and grafters, by useless sinecure-holders from among the nobility
and the royal family. The reorganization of the state, pointed out Mr.
Guchkov and his followers, must be taken from the hands of the effeminate
and imbecile Grand Dukes, and entrusted to representatives of the nation.
For such a heresy Guchkov had to resign from his post as head of the
“parliament,” and the work of reconstruction continued to be handled by
the old <em>chinovnicks</em>, the puppets of the Czar and of his uncles and cousins.
</p>

<p>
Public opinion in Russia has been crystallizing simultaneously with military
preparation and diplomatic negotiations. Austria’s annexation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina gave Russian diplomacy the gravest slap since the Berlin
Congress; Wilhelm’s threat to appear in “shining armor” to the assistance
of his ally compelled foreign minister Sasonov to withdraw his protest
against Austria’s act. The humiliation was felt deeply by all classes; the
Russian people have come to regard Germany as their bitterest foe, responsible
not only for their past and present military and diplomatic fiascoes, but
largely responsible also for the internal retrogressive policy of their government.
It has been widely known that during the last revolution the Kaiser
had counselled Nicolas “unrelenting firmness,” and had even offered to
“loan” his army for the suppression of the uprising. The popularity of the
present war in Russia is thus explained. The conservatives see in it an
opportunity to strengthen the power of the autocracy through drummed up
patriotism and loyalty to the throne; the liberals hope that with the defeat
of Germany there will come an end to the “dark influence” of the Prussian
retrogrades on Russia’s policy; the masses are eager to fight against the
“Antichrists,” the enemies of the Slavs and of the Slavonic church.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the outcome of this war may be, it has done inestimable
service for the awakening of Russia. The country has been elevated and
purified morally and nationally. The abolition of vodka, the unification of
differing parties and of hostile races, the liberal concessions granted by the
government,—these are the few tangible results of the war that can be
checked off already. But there is considerably more to come. The ignominious
failures of the army have pointed a burning finger of accusation
against the real enemy of the people, the bureaucracy. The Russian soldiers
have fought like lions ... led by asses. The shameless lack of munition, the
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
use of antiquated guns, the wretched equipment of the soldiers, the inefficiency
of field-hospitals, the continuing graft in giving out contracts,
the presence in the army of such time-proved nonentities as General Rennenkampf
and other Manchurian celebrities, these facts have shown to the
people that the Czar and his clique have forgotten everything and have
learned nothing. The general dissatisfaction in army circles and among
the civilians may bring about a storm that will sweep away the tottering
throne of Nicolas Romanov.
</p>

<p>
This is not a mere theoretic conjecture. Since 1904 an intense revolutionary
propaganda has been carried on within the army and navy. The
germ of rebellion has penetrated not only the common soldiers, who are
largely recruited from among the down-trodden peasants and workingmen,
but also the officers, who have learned a good deal in the last ten years.
A military <em>coup d’état</em> after the model of the Young Turks has become a
popular idea with the intelligent officers who cannot fail to see that the
autocratic régime is a detrimental anachronism. There have been persistent
rumors about the high ambitions of the ex-Supreme Commander. Grand
Duke Nicolas is a happy exception among the degenerated Romanovs. He
has been long considered as the “strong man,” and therefore feared and
opposed to by the Court-camarilla. Necessity compelled the Czar to appoint
him commander; his appointment was insistently recommended by Joffre
and Kitchener. Unlike Kuropatkin, the Grand Duke refused to follow
dictations from Petrograd. When in early spring he received an order from
the Czar to evacuate Warsaw, the commander telegraphed back that he
was willing to obey, but that he would move his army against the capital.
The order was recalled. The fact that he was recently removed from his
post and exiled to Caucasia shows the growing fears of the Czar, who has
lost his head and is hewing the branch on which he is still seated. The Grand
Duke had performed a difficult, although not very spectacular task—that of
saving the <em>unarmed</em> army from the iron grip of the Germans. Petrograd
demanded “action,” as it did ten years ago from Kuropatkin. Now that the
Czar has assumed the commandership of the army one may expect rapid
“actions,” Sedans and Tzusimas and an early peace treaty as honorable as
that of Portsmouth.
</p>

<p>
The sentiments of the population were characteristically voiced by the
Jewish member of the Duma, Friedman. In his speech he recounted the
unbelievable atrocities of the Russian authorities performed over the Jews
in the war-zone. Yet he said: “It is true we are without rights, we are
oppressed beyond endurance. But we know the foundation of the evil.
It emanates from these benches (pointing to the Ministers). We are persecuted
by the Russian government and not by the Russian people. It is not
to be wondered at, therefore, that we are content to bind our fate loyally
and faithfully with the fate of the Russian people, whatever may be done
to us by the Russian government.” The best of Russia are unanimously
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
determined that “the foundation of the evil” must go. In the last few
weeks various bodies of the Russian commonwealth have issued grave
resolutions condemning the government and demanding democratization of
the state. A revolution seems inevitable, but, to repeat, a military revolution
is most likely to take place. The bulk of the virile population is within
the fighting ranks, and it is there, in the army, that the national nerve pulsates
at present. Whether it be Grand Duke Nicolas, or another capable
and popular leader, it is to be expected that this time the army will pronounce
the verdict over the imbecile Czar and will cleanse the <a id="corr-14"></a>Augean
stables of the corrupted bureaucracy.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> is no wisdom but youth. There is no vision but the unafraid
impulse of unfettered nerves. The follies of youth are the enduring expressions
of art. Man loses his Ego at thirty and becomes conceited. He
becomes conscious of others. Life becomes a quibble. But youth! Youth,
the flower before it has decayed into the mellow moss of age. Youth that
knows not itself or the world. Youth that laughs at tears and weeps at
laughter. Youth that paints queer pictures at which the critics smile.
Illogical youth; arrogant youth; forever annoying the world’s stagnation.
Youth capering like a fawn in the altar places of the holy. Ho! you with
the pedantic whiskers and the ossified serenity lurking like a fog in your
eye—there is no wisdom but youth. Ho! you with the murk of maturity
thick upon your tongue—will you shape morals? I will unshape them. Will
you rear dogmas? I will upset them. Will you burden the world with your
heavy sagacity? I will ignore it. Ho, you didactic formulator, debauched
with facts, man is born a butterfly and crawls to his grave a worm. Man is
born young and dies old. Man is born wise and dies a fool. The ideas of
youth are his wings. Do you see the lightning maze of colors forever flashing
over your head? It is youth.
</p>

<p>
Ah! old Ossifus, your erudition is but the husk of my spirit. And my
spirit is the shop-boy whistling on his way to work, joyous without reason
for you have proved him an economic slave, stunted and damned forever to
rot in chains. My spirit is the lover going to his ruin-woman, and tumbling
out of heaven with a laugh. Ho! ho! old Petrifus, you have proved her the
root of evil, the despoiler of greatness, the velvet vandal of illusions, and yet
and yet....
</p>

<p>
And he is the artist running wild in the china-closet of the past. Have
you anything sacred, old whiskers? Have you something labelled right and
something labelled wrong? Show it to him. He will do for it. He is the
eternal monster killing the dead.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
There is no beauty but youth. There is no beauty in age. Ho! you
doddering banality with the superior tolerance in your stutter, you are decomposing
on your feet. Age is soiled. Age is dirty. Age drips with the
phlegm of life. Age is the unclean residue in the cup.

Ho!—there is no tomorrow.

Henri and Manship

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">O</span><span class="postfirstchar">ne</span> grows weary of the quibbling, the petty running about in circles
of critics, would-be-critics, and students with the eyes of their teachers
disputing “techniques,” values, and standards in regard to paintings that
somehow seem to live outside any limits pedants have placed. Out from the
noise the voice of the artist arises with a strength and clearness in words
similar to the quality of his paintings. Writing in the February <em>Craftsman</em>
of this year, telling of his work, his ideas, and his “people,” Robert Henri
has this to say:
</p>

<p>
“My love of mankind is individual. I am patriotic only about what I
admire, and my devotion to humanity burns as brightly for Europe as for
America. It flames up swiftly for Mexico if I am painting the peon there;
it warms towards the bull fighter of Spain if in spite of its cruelty there
is that element in his art which I find beautiful; it intensifies before the
Irish peasant whose love, poetry, simplicity, and humor have enriched my
existence just as completely as though these people were of my own country
and my own hearthstone. Everywhere I see at times this beautiful expression
of the dignity of life to which I respond with a wish to preserve
this beauty of humanity for my friends to enjoy.... The Chinese
American girl who has found coquetry in new freedom; the peon, a symbol
of a destroyed civilization in Mexico, and the Indian who works as one in
slavery and dreams as a man in still places ... all their lives are in
their expression, in their eyes, their movements or they are not worth translating
into art.”
</p>

<p>
He very simply tells what he feels about technique, which ought to
quiet the objection to his or any individual’s methods:
</p>

<p>
“Technique is merely a language, and as I grow older and see more
and more clearly I have but one intention and that is to make this language
as clear and simple and sincere as is humanly possible.... It is a language
of no value for its own sake.... It must be so translucent that it can be
forgotten, the value of the subject shining through it.”
</p>

<p>
A woman who sat for Henri last year for her portrait has this to say
of him in a recent letter:
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
“To me he is quite the most wonderful man among American artists;
so very big yet simple as a child; so very human yet utterly unconscious
of his humanity. He is much like Whitman only more tender, more subtle.
To Henri life is his art. That’s what makes him truly great. That’s what
made him go to the Ferrer School and awaken talent and even genius where
no one else would have seen anything to awaken. As a teacher Henri is
perhaps even greater than as a painter. I heard him explain things to his
class only twice, but I have never heard anything more fascinating and vivid.
His greatest worth, however, is his sense of freedom, his fervent belief that
only freedom can bring out the best in the individual. He is really an
anarchist though he does not label himself one.”
</p>

<p>
And thus the exhibit of twenty-five paintings at the Art Institute takes
on a broader and more beautiful air. It becomes human and alive even
though the noise from the studios is confusing.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Paul Manship also has a room at the Art Institute: Greek, Assyrian,
Japanese, Chinese, Egyptian, Italian, Roman, Gothic, and what not; but
where, oh where, is Paul Manship—“foremost American sculptor”? The
incongruous and nerve-racking thing about the collection is that besides
merely exactly reproducing all the above mentioned periods and styles he
goes so far as to use two or three in one piece of work. The <em>Infant Herakles:
fountain and bowl</em> is a terror of complications, with gothic gargoyles as the
high points of one’s discontent. The American Indian (with the African
animal skin and the Egyptian hair and Roman face) and pronghorn antelope
(Egyptian bronze of Alpine antelope) is the property of the Art Institute,
having been purchased by the “friends of American Art”.... The
conventionalized Roman busts with the Greek lettering were so top-heavy in
appearance that I grew quite dizzy....
</p>

<p>
I found relief in the sculptor of the Ancient Greeks,—peace in the simplicity
of a strange inspired beauty that intricate handling which draws on
past glories can never produce.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">hose</span> Scandinavians! I have often wondered at the combination of
grim strength with childlike imaginativeness that we find in the artists
of those pale cold lands. In the winter, at twilight, I like to sit with closed
eyes and to relive old and new Norse sagas, the unbelievable wonders told
or sung or painted with the perfect earnestness of absorbed children; I like
to dream then to the accompaniment of the not-smiling music of the sad child,
Edward Grieg.
</p>

<p>
<em>Jerusalem</em> is not a novel, not according to the terminology accepted <em>heretofore</em>.
For—may I reveal a secret <em>en passant</em>?—we are on the eve of the
publication of a novel by a Chicagoan who will revolutionize the prevailing
literary classifications. Another thing which is not! Selma Lagerlöf is <em>not</em>
a mystic, some of her friends want us to believe; not in the Maeterlinckian
sense. The book is a series of tapestries to be hung in an ideal children’s-room;
a web of fairy-tales told in the Scandinavian, unsmiling, earnest way.
Mystic? Yes, as much as all fairy-tales are mystic, as much as all not
“clever” and “wonderful” children are mystic. A mysticism which instead
of lifting us up to the clouds brings the clouds down to us; instead of lending
us wings and making us soar in imperceptible intangible regions, anthropomorphosizes
gods and spirits and drags them down to terra firma. So convincing!
We actually see the dead Ingmarssons gathered in a large farm
house up in heaven; we see their ruddy hard faces, sandy hair, white eyes;
we hear their slow, heavy, laconic talk. We are not surprised at meeting
Christ among the pines in the glow of the autumnal sunset. The opening of
heaven on a winter night before the eyes of the two Ingomars appears as
ordinary reality. We are in a world where everything is simple, believable,
possible. And you cannot smile; you are in an earnest childlike atmosphere.

either for <em>the lake or a padded cell</em>. God forbid you reach either. Let an old man
say that the only way to find life is to lose it. Forget it and reach out a hand to
the poor, the sick, the suffering, and the sinning. Happiness comes only in forgetfulness
of self and ministering to others. It is never the result of a theory but of
action. I have seen so many wrecked on the reefs toward which you are drifting
that I am fain to call out and entreat you to find happiness where alone it can be
found, not in fleeing from the world or cursing it but in thanking God you were
born into a world where you can be of some use to your fellows. Those lines of yours

Your magazine will die,—as a steam engine would grow useless in which no

you an example:—
</p>

<p>
Mr. Huntley Carter, in your September number, wrote on “Poetry versus
Imagism.” I happen to consider his article an ill-digested congeries of vague views;
but other persons may feel differently about it. What, however, can be the estimation
in which every sane and intelligent and decently responsible man will hold your magazine

ineptitude and carelessness as this:—

<p>
The spirit of revolt is compounded from many causes. Even in the average young
girl of whom Mr. Hecht writes in the August <span class="smallcaps">Little Review</span> it arises as much from
her digestion as from her incomplete physical functioning, as much from her work as
from her leisure, as much from her friends as from her freshness. Mr. Hecht would
be the first to admit that; would he be equally willing to admit that it meets death
variously?

He talks only of the family as the snuffer for the flame. This does not mean
that he excludes other causes, but it does mean that he has overemphasized one.
</p>

<p>
It is true, as Mr. Hecht insists, that the American family tends to quell revolt.
The battle of the generations is as old as the race; the family has always struggled
to bring the rebel into line for its own preservation. But that struggle in all its
various shades of acuteness has become a truism of modern thought, thanks to a
multiplex modern drama, a scientific sociology, and even the daily press. Why discuss
the subject only to dwell again heavily on the obvious?
</p>

<p>
The problem is far more complicated. The verdict of guilt against the family
grows monotonous when returned at every inquest. To place a single responsible
cause for any tremor to revolt that dies abortive is to lack subtlety.
</p>

<p>
Along with each verdict against the family there is also a verdict against the
individual. One is not to blame if she is not a genius, but if even her greatest
emotions are somewhat lacking in poignancy, the fluctuating spirit of restlessness in
her never reaches the heights which demand action.
</p>

<p>
Along with each verdict against the family there is also a verdict against the
quality of the revolutionary spirit. Not only are its causal factors weak and fluctuating,
but the very vagueness which to Mr. Hecht constitutes its charm spells also
its damnation. A spirit of restlessness is, in itself, nothing about which one can go
to the hilltops and shout, and when it crystalizes in some particular issue,—a book,
a picture, a small individual right,—the object often seems too trivial to struggle for.
To be sure the principle is not a small thing, but a principle is abstract and when
it confronts a concrete bit of suffering, it fades by contrast.
</p>

<p>
The sordid bread and butter difficulties to be faced by one standing wholly alone,
the scathing force of public opinion, the pain of others which, when you love them,
is pain to you,—these are realities which only the truly big souls dare to face. For
most of us the spirit of revolt is too diffuse even to demand action, and for most of
the rest action is too divine a consummation to be compassed by our weak human
spirit. Not to any external cause really, but to an inherent lack in us, is it due that
we slowly grow complacent, instead of crusading worthily in behalf of liberty.
</p>

<p class="from">
<em>Alice Groff, Philadelphia</em>:
</p>

<p>
The most of you publishers are such unspeakable Kaisers of Kultur that you treat
the geniuses who make you what you are as insignificant privates in a literary army,
which you deploy; keeping them dangling upon your critical pleasure, or blowing
them to pieces because they do not happen to walk the line <em>you</em> mark out.
</p>

<p>
I suppose this is inevitable, however, in the present social order and that there
will never be free literary expression until there is publishing organization on the
part of the whole people for the benefit of the whole people. May the universe speed
the day of such organization.

<em>The Drama</em> for November will be a notable number. Rabindranath
Tagore will contribute an article on the stage that crystallizes much of the
present diverse generalization, especially in discussions of stagecraft. Julius
Brouta, perhaps the most celebrated drama critic of Spain, will write of the
work of Benavente, a brilliant Spanish playwright of today. A puppet play
of Benavente, the popular <em>Los Interessos Creados</em>, will be printed in its entirety.
<em>The New Stage Art in its Relation to Drama</em> will be considered
from a new point of view by Alice Corbin Henderson. The articles begun
in the present number, <em>Playing Hamlet as Shakespeare Staged It in 1601</em>, by
Charlotte Porter, and <em>The Evolution of the Actor</em>, by Arthur Pollock, will
be concluded.
</p>

<p>
In November also will appear what promises to be one of the most
important pieces of dramatic poetry ever written in America, Edwin Arlington
Robinson’s <em>Ben Jonson Entertains a Man from Stratford</em>. In beauty
of verse, in poetic vision, and in its appreciation of the fine human quality
of Shakespeare the poem is a leading feature of the Shakespeare Tercentenary
Celebration.

Ignorance Is the Great Curse!
</p>

<p>
Do you know, for instance, the scientific difference between love and passion?
Human life is full of hideous exhibits of wretchedness due to ignorance of sexual
normality.
</p>

<p>
Stupid, pernicious prudery long has blinded us to sexual truth. Science was
slow in entering this vital field. In recent years commercialists eyeing profits have
unloaded many unscientific and dangerous sex books. Now the world’s great
scientific minds are dealing with this subject upon which human happiness often
depends. No longer is the subject tabooed among intelligent people.
</p>

<p>
<b>We take pleasure in offering to the American public, the work of one of the
world’s greatest authorities upon the question of sexual life. He is August
Forel, M.D., Ph.D., LL.D., of Zurich, Switzerland. His book will open your
eyes to yourself and explain many mysteries. You will be better for this
knowledge.</b>
</p>

<p>
Every <em>professional man and woman</em>, those dealing with social, medical, criminal,
legal, religious and educational matters will find this book of immediate value.
Nurses, police officials, heads of public institutions, writers, judges, clergymen
and teachers are urged to get this book at once.
</p>

<p>
The subject is treated from every point of view. The chapter on “love and other
irradiations of the sexual appetite” is a profound exposition of sex emotions—Contraceptive
means discussed—Degeneracy exposed—A guide to all in domestic
relations—A great book by a great man.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
